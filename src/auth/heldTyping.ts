/**
 * What the person was typing when their sign-in ended, kept through the passkey
 * trip (AUT-4; Decided 17 Oct: "kept on the device through the passkey trip and
 * put back, unsaved, after the tap, as the comment box already does").
 *
 * The comment box already keeps its drafts on the device as you type
 * (`lib/drafts.ts`). The description, the New issue and New project dialogs and
 * a message being edited keep nothing, and the passkey screen takes their page's
 * place: so each registers a reader while it is open ({@link useHeldTyping}),
 * and the ending reads them all ({@link holdTyping}) before `SessionGate` draws.
 * Coming back, each takes its text ({@link heldText}) and starts from it, not
 * yet saved.
 *
 * Only for an ending. Another tab signing out is a sign-out, and what was read
 * or typed does not stay on the device past one
 * (why: https://github.com/estiva-app/estiva-docs/blob/main/decisions/peek-keeps-a-plain-copy-on-the-device-until-sign-out.md).
 *
 * Kept per person: whoever signs in next on this device gets only their own.
